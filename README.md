# 🦷 Multilingual Dental Practice Management System

This is an AI-powered, full-stack dental management system designed for dental clinics. It features a multilingual voice assistant, an intelligent booking backend, and a modern web frontend — all built using open-source tools and language models.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Multilingual Voice Assistant** (English & Spanish)  
  Voice commands enable patients to book, manage, or inquire about appointments in natural language.

- **LLM-Augmented Backend**  
  Built with FastAPI, ChatGPT, and LangChain to extract intent, handle time normalization, and generate structured appointment data.

- **Modern UI Prototyped with Bolt.new**  
  Designed rapidly with Bolt.new and implemented in React/TypeScript with Tailwind CSS for clean, responsive user interfaces.

- **NER-Powered Medical Understanding**  
  Uses Hugging Face (`HUMADEX/spanish_medical_ner`) and SciSpacy models to extract symptoms, procedures, and medical entities.

- **Offline Voice Recognition**  
  Uses VOSK for fast, privacy-friendly speech-to-text without cloud dependency.
